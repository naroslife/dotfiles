# Dotfiles Cleanup and Modernization Summary

## What Was Cleaned Up

### 1. **Modernized home.nix Configuration**
- Added proper tool version management based on `.tool-versions`
- Integrated all shell configurations (bash, zsh, elvish) 
- Added comprehensive tool integrations (starship, zoxide, atuin, fzf, direnv)
- Included proper package management for development tools
- Added configuration file management for all tools

### 2. **Integrated Previously Separate Configurations**
- **zshrc/**: Converted standalone zsh config to Home Manager `programs.zsh`
- **tmuxinator/**: Properly linked tmuxinator configurations
- **termscp/**: Added termscp configuration management
- **carapace/**: Integrated carapace completion framework
- **.tool-versions**: Used for version specifications (Python 3.12.5, Java 11, Ruby 3.3.4, CMake 3.27.0)

### 3. **Submodule Integration**
- **base/**: Shell framework automatically sourced in both bash and zsh
- **stdlib.sh/**: Bash standard library automatically sourced
- **util-linux/**: Referenced for custom builds (build process documented)

### 4. **Enhanced Shell Experience**
- Consistent aliases across bash and zsh
- Proper VI mode and key bindings
- Custom functions (cx, fcd, f, fv, ranger integration)
- Carapace completion initialization
- FZF integration with fd

### 5. **Tool Versions and Package Management**
- Python 3.12.5 with pycodestyle
- Ruby 3.3.4 with tmuxinator
- JDK 17 (upgraded from generic JDK)
- Added kubectl, kubectx, kubens for Kubernetes
- Added network tools (nmap, xh)
- Added file managers (ranger)
- Added completion frameworks (carapace, bash-completion, zsh-completions)

### 6. **Configuration File Management**
All config files are now properly managed by Home Manager:
- Starship prompt configuration
- Atuin history configuration  
- SSH configuration
- Tmux configuration
- Tmuxinator session configs
- Termscp settings
- Carapace completion specs
- Elvish shell configuration
- Neovim configuration

### 7. **Environment Variables**
Properly set important environment variables:
- `EDITOR=nvim`
- `KUBECONFIG=$HOME/.kube/config`
- `XDG_CONFIG_HOME=$HOME/.config`
- `FZF_DEFAULT_COMMAND=fd --type f --hidden --follow`
- `STARSHIP_CONFIG=$HOME/.config/starship/starship.toml`

### 8. **Improved Apply Script**
Enhanced `apply.sh` with:
- Better error handling
- Submodule initialization
- Informative output
- Proper checking for dependencies

## What Was Removed/Consolidated

### Files that were integrated into home.nix:
- Standalone zsh configuration (now in `programs.zsh`)
- Individual tool configurations (now managed by Home Manager)
- Manual sourcing of tools (now handled by Home Manager integrations)

### What's Now Automatically Handled:
- Tool integrations (starship, zoxide, atuin, fzf, direnv)
- Shell completions and auto-suggestions
- Configuration file linking
- Environment variable setting
- Package installation and management

## Benefits of the Cleanup

1. **Reproducibility**: Everything is now managed by Nix/Home Manager
2. **Consistency**: Same configuration works across different machines
3. **Maintainability**: Single source of truth in `home.nix`
4. **Integration**: All tools work together seamlessly
5. **Version Control**: Tool versions explicitly specified
6. **Modularity**: Easy to enable/disable individual tools
7. **Documentation**: Clear structure and comprehensive README

## Next Steps

1. Run `./apply.sh` to apply the new configuration
2. Restart your shell or run `exec $SHELL`
3. Test that all tools work correctly
4. Customize further by editing `home.nix`
5. Add any additional tools or configurations as needed

The dotfiles are now much cleaner, more maintainable, and provide a comprehensive development environment!
